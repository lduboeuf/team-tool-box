    <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to Team ToolBox, a project to help you work or play with teams/groups randomly!</p>
    <p>It helps whenever we need to pick someone, don't find volunteers, define teams (practical exercises, collective workshops etc...) , define passing order or assign tasks.</p>
    <p>This tool may be useful for trainers, teachers, managers or anyone else who works with or within groups.</p>
